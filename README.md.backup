### Current Version 0.1
Everything is currently run from one Java Class. User must manually input their own numbers for gems.

**How to run the program**
1. Download the source code
2. Open it and compile in your IDE. (This was written using IntelliJ)
3. Follow the input prompts to see the value of your stashed gems

**Changes**

>[12/13/22] Added comments for how to encapsulate and abstract the code. To be turned an actual Calculator Object.

>[11/22/22] So far this program is very rudimentary. It runs once, asks the user to input the number of gems in their bags, and the program will calculate the individual and total gold value of each and all gems they possess.
Future changes will be to convert a lot of the functionality into methods, implement a constructor so a calculator object can be called to run the functions, and eliminate so much of the repetitive code. For the time being the program does what I need it to do.
